This shows part of the visualized bounding boxes obtained using PointPillar on the DAIR dataset, after registration using extrinsic parameters from V2I-Calib and those provided by the dataset authors, respectively. In the video, we visualize the point clouds. The left side shows the results after registration using extrinsic parameters predicted by our method in V2I-Calib++, while the right side shows the results using the extrinsic parameters provided by the DAIR dataset authors.
