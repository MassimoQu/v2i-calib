## visualization results
### merged_output.mp4
This shows part of the visualized bounding boxes obtained using PointPillar on the DAIR dataset, after registration using extrinsic parameters from V2I-Calib and those provided by the dataset authors, respectively. In the video, we visualize the point clouds. The left side shows the results after registration using extrinsic parameters predicted by our method in V2I-Calib++, while the right side shows the results using the extrinsic parameters provided by the DAIR dataset authors.
### delay_scene.mp4
Here we show the visualization results of detection boxes obtained using the authors' PointPillars weights on the DAIR dataset under different latency scenarios, following registration with external parameters obtained through the V2I-Calib++ calibration method.
